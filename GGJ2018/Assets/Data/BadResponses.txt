Of course I feel the same way.
Right back at you, big guy.
I like you better quiet.
I like your shirt. Can you take it off?
I want to *** on your ****
Come closer. Show me your muscle.
Hi there big boy.
You should talk less and smile more. 
Do you want to come back to my place?
Show me your little member.
You talk the talk but can you walk the walk?
You should talk less.
You have a beatiful smile. 
What a fine piece of ass.
Are you sure you know what that is? I can explain it to you. 
You don't know what you're talking about. It's fine. 
It's sweet that you're trying. 
You're adorable. 
You should use your looks to get ahead. 
If you want anything you need to show a little skin. 
Ew. Ew. Ew. 
I'd tap that
I know you want me to listen. But nope.
Did it hurt when you fell down from heaven?
You're not marriage material but I guess you're good for one night. 
I would agree if I was paying attention.
