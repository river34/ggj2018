Hmm...
I see your point. 
Okay. 
How about you?
Tell me more. 
How was your day?
Maybe. 
Cool. 
This reminds me of the summer I spent in France teaching French kids to be nice. 
This reminds me of the winter I spent in Russia learning the art of making a Matryoshka.
This reminds me of something...not sure what. 
I was saying that to my friend just the other day. 
Interesting. I just read about it yesterday. 
Go on...
And?
How do you feel about that?
Can you say that again?
I want to hear more!
Cool!
